{
    "Scope Definitions": [
        {
            "Take": "A \u201ctake\u201d in film production is a single continuous recorded performance of a particular shot or scene, starting when the director calls \u201caction\u201d and ending when they call \u201ccut\u201d. Multiple takes are often shot to capture different versions, allowing choices in editing to present the best performance or technical execution.",
            "Slate": "A \u201cslate\u201d refers to the clapperboard, a tool displayed in front of the camera at the start of a take, used to visually and audibly record details like the scene, shot, and take numbers for identification in post production. The slate ensures each take is uniquely labeled, aiding editors and VFX teams in tracking footage through the workflow.",
            "Setup": "In film production, a \u201csetup\u201d refers to the arrangement of camera position, lighting scheme, actor blocking, props, and set dressing that is required to capture one or more shots from a specific viewpoint or configuration. Each setup is distinct, and a new setup occurs whenever any of these elements\u2014especially the camera position or lighting\u2014are changed to achieve a different shot or look. This concept is key in scheduling and organizing a shoot efficiently, as multiple shots can sometimes be filmed from a single setup before moving equipment to create a new one",
            "Lighting setup": "The exact configuration of on-set lighting deployed, often varies per take. Proper lighting is crucial for both live-action and VFX integration.",
            "Character": "A \u201ccharacter\u201d in film production is any fictional or real persona portrayed by an actor or performer within a story. The character is defined by specific traits, behaviors, and a narrative role, serving as a key element that drives the plot, interacts with other characters, and helps communicate the film\u2019s themes. Each character is assigned to a performer and may be tracked during production and post production for continuity and VFX needs. A type of Asset but distinct from sets and props.",
            "Vehicle": "Film Vehicles: Vehicles that appear on camera within scenes, such as cars, motorcycles, or trucks driven by actors or used as part of the story. Production Vehicles: Specialized vehicles used behind the scenes to transport equipment, crew, or provide mobile workspace. Examples include grip and electric trucks carrying lighting and rigging gear, camera trucks with specialized mounts and climate control for camera equipment, wardrobe and makeup trucks for talent preparation, and production office trucks for administrative use. These vehicles are critical for logistical support and smooth operation on location. Vehicle Rigs: For filming car scenes especially, production vehicles may be outfitted with camera mounts, lighting setups, and power supplies to enable dynamic shots while in motion (camera cars). Thus, vehicles play both an on-screen storytelling role and an off-screen supporting role essential to film production logistics, equipment transport, and specialized shooting setup As with character, a sub category of Asset.",
            "Camera": "Referring to the back-end capture device body (typically not including the lens). A \u201ccamera\u201d in filmmaking is the device used to capture the visual elements of a film or video. It records scenes and shots, translating the director\u2019s and cinematographer\u2019s vision into moving images.",
            "Lens": "Referring to the front-end capture device, can differ per take. A \u201clens\u201d in filmmaking is an optical device attached to the camera that focuses and controls how light enters the camera sensor or film to capture an image. The lens affects the image\u2019s sharpness, perspective, depth of field, field of view, and overall aesthetic",
            "Shot": "A continuous sequence of frames captured without interruption. In VFX, a shot is the segment that requires visual effects work and is defined by the camera running from \u201cstart\u201d to \u201cstop,\u201d making it a basic unit for VFX budgeting and scheduling.",
            "Sequence": "A \u201csequence\u201d is a series of shots that together form a distinct unit of the film, often representing a complete scene or action where they are thematically or logically connected. Sequences help organize the film\u2019s narrative and VFX planning.",
            "Set": "The physical build created by the Art Department or procured by Production for the purposes of filming.",
            "Production location": "Production location refers to the specific place where filming occurs, either outdoors or indoors, which may be an actual place or a set constructed to represent that place. Locations influence how scenes are lit, filmed, and what VFX may be required for environmental enhancements.",
            "Virtual stage": "The environment which integrates physical and virtual production. Typically a set of LED panels, projection screens and/or process screens for keying.",
            "Prop": "A prop is any physical object used by actors or set dressing present in a scene that isn\u2019t part of the set or costume, Props add realism, serve storytelling functions, and may include practical items on-set or digital objects inserted via VFX.",
            "Actor": "An actor is a performer who plays a character in a film. Actors deliver dialogue, interact with other performers and with practical or digital elements in scenes, and are often the core focus for integrating visual effects.",
            "Animal performer": "An animal performer is any trained animal used in place of a human actor in certain scenes or shots. Animal performers might be real or represented by digital doubles with VFX for safety, realism, or creative reasons.",
            "Character_per_take": "This refers to tracking which character(s) appear in each filmed take. A \u201ctake\u201d is a single attempt at recording a shot, and documenting \u201ccharacter_per_take\u201d is essential for VFX teams to plan the required work for each character\u2019s appearance and interaction in a scene.",
            "Performance": "In some circumstances an actor may be required to create multiple performances in a single take.",
            "Extras": "Extras, also known as background actors or atmosphere players, are performers who fill out a scene to create a realistic background. They usually do not have lines but add to the authenticity of the environment by representing crowds, passersby, or bystanders.",
            "Physical asset": "A physical asset in filmmaking includes tangible items such as set pieces, costumes, props, camera equipment, or any real object physically present on set, relevant for reference or interaction by actors - including those later replaced or enhanced by VFX.",
            "Digital and artistic assets": "Digital and artistic assets refer to computer-generated elements like 3D models, matte paintings, visual effects layers. and animation files. These are created by VFX artists and inserted into scenes to realize effects, creatures, environments, or otherwise enhance or alter the filmed footage digitally."
